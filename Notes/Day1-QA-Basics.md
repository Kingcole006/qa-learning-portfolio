# Day 1 – QA Basics

## Overview
Short intro: testing verifies software behavior and finds defects before users do.

## Key definitions
- Software testing: verifying actual vs expected behavior.  
- QA (Quality Assurance): process improvements to prevent defects.  
- Bug: deviation of actual behavior from expected behavior.

## Why QA matters
- Prevent broken features  
- Improve user experience  
- Save money and maintain user trust

## Basic testing types
- Functional testing  
- Regression testing  
- Smoke / Sanity testing  
- Exploratory testing  
- Manual vs Automated testing

## Quick bug report template
- Summary:  
- Steps to reproduce:  
- Expected result:  
- Actual result:  
- Severity/Priority:  
- Environment (OS, browser, build):  
- Attachments (screenshots, logs):

## Quick testing checklist
- Reproduce issue reliably  
- Verify expected behavior and edge cases  
- Check logs and environment details  
- File a clear bug report with steps and evidence  
- Retest after fix

## What I learned today
- QA is thinking, not random clicking  
- Bugs must be clearly explained  
- Testing requires curiosity and systems thinking

## Next steps
- Practice exploratory sessions, write clear bug reports, learn a basic automation tool (e.g., Selenium or Playwright)
## What is Software (from video)
Software: a set of instructions/programs that tell a computer how to perform tasks.

## Types of Software
- System software — device drivers, operating systems, servers, utilities  
- Programming software — compilers, debuggers, interpreters  
- Application software — web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps

## What is Software Testing
Activity to verify that software meets requirements and to detect defects before users encounter them. 
Objective: release a quality product to the client.

## What is Software Quality
- Bug-free behavior where possible  
- Delivered on time and within budget  
- Meets client requirements and expectations  
- Maintainable and user-friendly
- Quality is not only about being bug-free, but about meeting user needs reliably.

## Why Testing is Needed
- Software can fail in real-world scenarios  
- Bugs are costlier if found late  
- Testing improves product quality and user trust

## Project vs Product
- Project: built for a specific customer per requirements  
- Product: built for multiple customers based on market needs

## Error vs Bug vs Failure
- Error: human mistake (developer)  
- Bug/Defect: flaw in software (identified by testers)  
- Failure: observable incorrect behavior experienced by users

## Why Software Has Bugs
- Miscommunication between teams  
- System complexity  
- Programming mistakes  
- Changing or misunderstood requirements  
- Insufficiently skilled testing (testing requires intentionally breaking the software)
