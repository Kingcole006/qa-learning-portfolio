# Day 6 – Postman Test Scripts

Learned how to automate API validation using Postman Tests tab.

Automated:
- Status code validation
- JSON field validation
- Value assertion
- Response time validation

This eliminates manual checking and creates repeatable automated tests.

## Key learning
Automated tests can pass/fail independently. Assertion failures clearly show expected vs actual values.

## Added smarter assertions
- Validated id is a positive number
- Validated response contains required keys (userId, id, title, body)
