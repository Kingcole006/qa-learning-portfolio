# Day 2 – Core QA Concepts

## What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
A process used by software industry to design, develop, & test software's.
1. Requirements Analysis
2. Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Maintenance

## Black-Box Testing
  - Testing software without knowing the internal code.(We don't know what's inside the box)
  - Focuses on inputs, outputs, and user behaviour.
  - Code doesn't need to be understood, as we are testing that the software is working as expected.

## Static vs Dynamic Testing
- Static testing: Testing the project related documents, requirements, test cases
   - Reviewing the document
   - Walkthrough of the document
   - Insepction that the docuemnt is correct

- Dynamic testing: Executing/testing the software to find defects
   - Unit Testing
   - Integration testing
   - System testing
   - User Acceptance testing

## Verification vs Validation
- Verification: are we building the right product?
  > Focuses on docuemntation
  > Verification involves: Static Testing Techniques
    - Reviews
    - Walkthroughs
    - Inspections

- Validation: are we building the product correctly?
  > Takes place after verifications are completed
  > Focuses on Software
  >Validation involves: Dynamic Testing Techniques
    - Unit testing
    - Integration testing
    - System testing
    - User Acceptance testing

## Why Black-Box Testing Matters for QA
- QA tests from a user perspective
- Does not require coding knowledge
- Helps catch real user-facing issues
