# Day 3 – Edge Cases

## What is an Edge Case
An edge case tests how the system behaves at limits or unusual conditions.

## Why Edge Cases Matter
- Users don’t always follow the happy path
- Edge cases often reveal hidden bugs
- They improve software reliability

## Examples of Edge Cases
- Empty input fields
- Extremely long text
- Invalid characters
- Rapid repeated actions

## Test Scenario vs Test Case
- Test scenario: high-level feature or user flow to test
- Test case: detailed steps and expected result
- One scenario can have many test cases
